	<h2>A Hidden Nerd</h2>
		<p>Most people don't expect me to be the computer programming, math loving, science oriented person I am. Maybe it's the blonde hair. Or the sorority. Or the general stereotype of being a female. Telling people I meet that I attended a science and tech high school has led to some of strangest reactions and definitley some disbelief. But I'll be the first to proudly admit that I am definitely a nerd. I watch TED talks in my spare time, worked at a science summer camp last summer, and love reading.</p>

		<h2>Academic Interests</h2>
		<p>Remember that time I wanted to be a doctor? Yeah, me too. And those aren't fond memories. One year of organic chemistry later, some practical thinking, and the realization that becoming a doctor would not be like Grey's Anatomy, I've happily given up that goal. My course load didn't change too much - math, science, and tech are still my favorite academic topics. The brian fascinates me.</p>

		<h2>Mr. Jefferson's University</h2>
		<p>I'm proud to call the University of Virginia my home away from home, or even my actual home (much to my mother's dismay). The past two years at UVA have been absolutely incredible. The friends I've made, the experiences I've shared with them, and the adventures still to come make me realize how lucky I am to be at the best university in the world. I mean who wouldn't want to study on the lawn by day and run down it naked by night? And then there was the time I ran into Katie Couric.</p>

		<p>Beyond the celeb alumni, beautiful and sometimes snowy weather, and perfect location, UVA is one of the most fun places to be on any given day. A capella concerts, horse races, football games, dinners downtown, dafe functions, the list goes on.</p>
