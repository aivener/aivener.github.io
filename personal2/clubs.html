	<h2>Young Women Leader's Program</h2>
	<p>At UVA, I am a "Big Sister" for the Young Women Leader's Program (YWLP). My "Little Sister's" name was Xio. The program aims to encourage middle school aged girls to reach their full potential through the motivation of college aged women. Xio and I had an incredible year together, and I often forgot she was six years younger than me! </p>

	<h2>Kappa Delta</h2>

	<p>I joined Kappa Delta sorority during the second semester of my first year of college. Now, I am Vice President-Operations. Essentially I'm the calendar maker, event planner, and form-doer. It's not a major role, but I've liked giving back to such an amazing group of people! And I have made some of my best friends in the process!</p>

	<h2>TEDxUVA</h2>
	<img src="../../pictures/ted.jpg">
	<p>The slogan of TED is "Ideas Worth Spreading". As a thinker, reader, learner, and outgoing person, I found that motto to be perfectly fitting for my lifestyle. Joining TEDxUVA caused me to think in ways I never had before, meet and communicate with all different types of people, and learn a lot along the way. The second TEDxUVA event occurred in April 2014, and we hope to have many more to come!</p>

	<h2>Honor</h2>
	<p>UVA's well-known student-run Honor Policy is considered harsh by many, but I have found a challenging yet rewarding place within the system. I act as an investigator of reported honor offences and a lawyer-type figure during honor trials. It's tough and full of late nights, but totally worth it. </p>
