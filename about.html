			<h2>The Basics</h2>
			<ul class="basics">
				<li>I'm from the classic American family. Mom, Dad, little brother, and a dog. Suburban neighborhood outside of Washington, DC. Typical.</li>
				<li>I'm the classic American college student. Involved in too many clubs for my own good, majoring in Cognitive Science and Computer Science, and entirely too busy. Wahoowa!</li>
				<li>I miss playing on sports teams more than anything. Field hockey and soccer took up most of my time in high school, and I wish I could pick up a stick and relive the sports season. Too bad college sports take up more time than I'd ever have time for.</li>

				<h2>Family</h2>
				<img src="../../pictures/family.jpg" class="fampic">
				<p>Nothing is more important to me than my family. My mom and dad are among the most motivating and encouraging people I know, and my little (but much taller) brother, Chris, provides the comic relief. My dog, Dodger, is the perfect animal. The Ivener fam has travelled all over the place together - over 20 states and over 7 countries. The trips to Portugal and Europe, as well as down the California coast, were spectacular. We dive into the local culture, experience things we never could in our hometown, and make lasting memories. My grandparents live only 5 minutes from my house, so I see them often. I have cousins in Tampa and in New York.</p>

				<h2>Outdoors</h2>
				<img src="../../pictures/climbing.jpg" class="climbingpic">
				<p>I absolutely love spending time outside. I started playing soccer when I was 5 years old, and played through high school and still try to get some pick up or intramural games in here and there. Field hockey became my main sport in high school, and I even received an Honorable Mention All-Met award my senior year. Now I try to run when I can and be outside as much as possible. I've recently picked up rock climbing and love the thrill and physical challenge that each climb brings. I am lucky to live right by Great Falls National Park which has amazing climbs right on the river. It makes for the perfect summer day with friends.</p>

				<h2 id="heartbroken">A Heartbroken Fan</h2>
				<img src="../../pictures/caps.jpg" class="caps">
				<p class="caps">The Washington Capitals break my heart. Every. Single. Year. <br><br> Since I was a kid, I have been a hardcore Caps fan, largely thanks to my dad. Attending games is easily one of my favorite childhood memories. I have even gone bowling with some of the players! I could talk forever about game strategies, the coaching staff, the players, the recruits. I even won a bet with a guy in 8th grade when I listed 15 players and their numbers. <br><br> Aside from the game strategy and excitement ice hockey brings, it also has helped me form a great relationship with my dad. Family is a huge part of my life, and being a Caps fan instantly connected me with my dad. It's shocking how many more phone minutes I use during hockey season to call my dad to analyze the last game or player injury. So dad, if you're reading this, thanks for everything! <br><br> In all seriousness though, the year the Caps win the Stanley Cup, or even make it past the first round of the playoffs, will be the best year of my life.</p>
