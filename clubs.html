		<h2>22seven Web Intern</h2>
		<p>22seven is a finance monitoring web and mobile application based out of Cape Town, South Africa. For four weeks, I interned at 22seven and redesigned their blog. I added functionality, such as search, categorization, and subscription, and I redesigned the front end. While their web application is based in Ruby on Rails, a language I had learned prior to interning, I worked primarily with php and wordpress, along with CSS for styling. The result of my work can be seen at <a href="https://blog.22seven.com/" target="_blank">blog.22seven.com</a>.</p>

		<h2>ideaventions Lab Leader</h2>
		<p>I worked at ideaventions, a discovery lab for kids, during the summer of 2013. Each week, ideaventions hosted themed science and technology related day camps for elementary school aged students. Prior to the first camp for the summer, I helped to improve the weekly lesson plans and design a new camp week. I independently taught labs to groups of eight to ten campers once the camps began.

		<h2>TEDxUVA</h2>
		<p>I am a founding member, past logistics committee chair, and current secretary of TEDxUVA. Each year, the Organizing Committee of TEDxUVA plans and executes a Student Speaker Competition to choose UVA students to speak at our annual TEDxUVA conference. As the logistics committee chair, I led a team of six in choosing and obtaining a venue, facilitating the design and implementation of the stage design, and in coordinating the details of the event. The third annual TEDxUVA conference will be held in February or March 2015. To learn more about TEDxUVA, visit <a href="http://www.tedxuva.com" target="_blank">www.tedxuva.com</a>.</p>

		<h2>Honor Support Officer</h2>
		<p>The University of Virginia holds honor in high regard and in turn has a strict and valued honor code. As an Honor Support Officer for the system, I investigate cases, represent students or reporters at trial, and work to educate the University community about the honor system. In the spring of 2014, I was selected from over 70 members to be a Senior Support Officer. I helped in selecting the new Support Officer class and am now training the new members. I also was chosen as a Pre-Trial Coordinator. I run pre-trial conferences and lead the discussion to decide what is permitted in trial.</p>

		<h2>Young Women Leaders Program</h2>
		<p>During the 2013-2014 school year, I had a "little sister" through the Young Women Leaders Program. My "little sister", a girl from a low-income family in eighth grade a local middle school, was identified as having the potential to thrive in high school and, hopefully, attend college. Throughout the year, I spent time with her both at her middle school and in the community, sharing meals, studying, and having fun.</p>
